🦚 Ruby and 🦩 JS are my two languages of choice right now.

I like to build products that bring a shine in my eyes. My current favorite ones include:

(i) 🦜 [Numero](https://altcampus.github.io/numero/build/index.html) 

(ii) 🦉 [triKone](https://bharat-patodi.github.io/trikone/)

I try to help open-source projects as much as I can. The following are some Indian open-source projects that I like to interact with:

(a) 🦓 [remoteIndian](https://github.com/remoteindian/remoteindian) 

(b) 🦄 [chatwoot](https://github.com/chatwoot/chatwoot)

I don't actively plagiarize. I like to own my own creations, but if it happens, I'm ready to face the heat.
